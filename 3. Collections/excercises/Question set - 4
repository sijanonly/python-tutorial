1. Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

2.Write a Python program to combine values in python list of dictionaries.

Sample data: [{'item': 'item1', 'amount': 400}, {'item': 'item2', 'amount': 300}, {'item': 'item1', 'amount': 750}]
Expected Output: Counter({'item1': 1150, 'item2': 300})


3. Write a Python program to create a dictionary from a string. 
NOTE: Track the count of the letters from the string.

4.  Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.

e.g., madam

5.  Create list comprehension for following code:

  5.a 
  	numbers = [1, 5, 2, 12, 14, 7, 18]
  	even_sq_numbers = []
	for number in numbers:
	    if number % 2 == 0:
	        even_sq_numbers.append(number*number)

  5.b
		word = 'python is awesome'
		cap_list = []
		for char in word:
			if char not in 'aeiou':
			    cap_list.append(char.upper())
